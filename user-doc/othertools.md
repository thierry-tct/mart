# Mutant generation utilities

There is a utility called `mart-utils` that can be used to post precess the output of Mart.
This can be used to generate individual mutants bitcode when Mart was run to only generate Meta-mutant bitcode file.

For the usage, check the script [mutants_bc_from_meta](https://github.com/thierry-tct/mart/blob/adding_llvm11_support/scripts/utils/mutants_bc_from_meta.py).
